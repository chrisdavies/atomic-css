# Atomic-css

This is a small demo of what a zero-dependency Tailwind implementation might look like.

## Getting started

- [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Run `bun start`

## Source code

See [lib/atomic-css](lib/atomic-css) for the Tailwind-like part of the project. The rest of the project is just a really dumb demo application.
