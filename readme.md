# Atomic-css

This is a small demo of what a zero-dependency Tailwind implementation might look like.

## Getting started

- [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Run `bun start`
- Go to [http://localhost:3000]
- Play

## Play

Modify `pages/home/index.tsx` to play around. The application should refresh any time you save your changes.

## Source code

See [lib/atomic-css](lib/atomic-css) for the Tailwind-like part of the project. The rest of the project is just a really dumb demo application.

## Why the heck did I build this?

Good question. I wrote a [little blog post](https://christophilus.com/blog/bun-diy-tailwind-like-css-processing) about that.
